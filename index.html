                        <p class="padding-top-5">With proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, and Core Java, I have developed dynamic and interactive web applications, utilizing these skills to create engaging user experiences. I have successfully developed table-based HTML prototypes, accurately translating design mockups into functional web interfaces. By translating designs into JSP code, I ensured seamless integration of front-end components with server-side logic, facilitating efficient and effective web development. With a focus on maintaining consistency and quality, I designed and managed UI elements, adhering to coding standards throughout the application. Additionally, I played a key role in planning website development, converting mockups into usable web presence using HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, and JSON coding. Adhering to SEO best practices, I ensured that the websites I designed were optimized for search engines. Moreover, I applied emerging technologies to update and maintain the applicability of websites, staying current with industry trends and advancements.</p>
